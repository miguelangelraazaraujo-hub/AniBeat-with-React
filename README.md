<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

AniBeat is a dynamic web platform dedicated to anime music enthusiasts. It combines the sleek data visualization of **Spotify Wrapped** and **Microsoft Edge | Year in Review**, the community features of **AniList**, and the energetic UI/UX of **osu!** to create a unique space where users can:

- Discover new anime tracks and artists  
- Build and manage personal playlists ("My Playlist")  
- Track their listening history and stats  
- Engage with a community through fanarts, forums, and contests  
- Experience seasonal recaps like "AniBeat Wrapped"

Designed with a dark theme, smooth animations, and responsive layouts, AniBeat offers an immersive experience that feels both familiar and fresh.

- 📱 **Fully Responsive Design**: Mobile-first header with hamburger menu and expandable sections.
- 🧭 **Interactive Navigation**: Hover-activated mega-menus on desktop, tap-to-expand on mobile.
- 📊 **Dynamic Content Sections**: News feed, featured maps, daily challenges, and popular tracks.
- 🔒 **Legal Compliance**: Full GDPR-ready pages: Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Sale.
- 🗺️ **Location-aware Features**: Integrated map views using **Leaflet** for community events or artist locations.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Gradient headers, animated overlays, and card-based layouts inspired by osu! and Spotify.
